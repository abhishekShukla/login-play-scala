This project is a login boiler plate for Play! apps. 

The boiler plate includes:

1. Facebook login
2. Twitter login
3. Github login
4. Username/password login

Note: This is my first scala project. Since I come from java, I am sure I would have written java in scala. 

Play version: 2.2.x
Scala version: 2.10.x
SecureSocial: 2.1.3
MySQL: 5.6.x
